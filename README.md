- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Josh Wright, but I sometimes go by jwright.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development, art, auto mechanics, music, philosophy, and the cosmic out there.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning every single day. It's probably my favorite thing.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I think riding a bicycle anywhere is some of the most fun you can have.
